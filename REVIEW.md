# Blipbird — Review findings & work backlog

The living successor to the July 2026 review documents: the Fable full-codebase
review, the GLM 5.2 review, the DeepSeek v4 review, and the interim
`ANALYSIS.md` backlogs. The raw point-in-time snapshots are archived under
[`docs/reviews/`](docs/reviews/) (`fable.md`, `glm.md`, `glm-analysis.md`,
`ds4.md`); **this file is the single source of truth going forward.** IDs are
stable so PRs and discussions can keep referencing them: `B/G/P/V/F/I` from the
Fable review, `glm x.y` from the GLM review, `DS4-*` from the DeepSeek review.

Everything implemented has been pruned from this file (July 2026 cleanup, at
v1.0.0). The record of *what* landed and *which PR carried it* lives in the git
history of this file, the closed PRs (#13–#62), and the archived snapshots.
Every item below was re-verified against the code at cleanup time — it is
genuinely still open.

## Open bugs

None currently prioritized — the remaining known findings are deliberate
deferrals, recorded under **Won't do (for now)** below.

## Won't do (for now)

Fixable, but the cost/benefit doesn't land yet — parked here so they stop
resurfacing in every review. Each notes what would flip the call.

- **B14n — collision-free notification IDs.** #27's
  `floorMod(flightId, 500M) * 4 + channelIndex` is provably collision-free vs the
  landed mixed hash (collisions astronomically unlikely, not impossible).
  *Not now:* the ongoing in-flight notification would orphan on the update that
  ships the new scheme — the new id can't cancel a card posted under the
  old-hash id — for a benefit that only bites if ids ever need to be forensically
  stable. *Revisit* if ids start mattering forensically, or fold it into a
  notification rework that can clear the stale cards.

- **DS4-P10 — `planeBitmap` renders on the composition thread** on first use
  (cached after). *Not now:* moving it off-thread would make the live aircraft
  icon appear a frame late — worse than the sub-millisecond one-time draw it
  removes. *Revisit* by converting it to a bundled vector drawable (no runtime
  draw at all), which is the real fix.

- **DS4-V19 — Ribbon weather glyphs are evenly spaced** (`weight(1f)`) rather than
  at their true along-route position (would sharpen V7). *Not now:*
  `WeatherSample.fraction` is only an even `i/(n-1)` index, so the real position
  isn't available at the ribbon; a correct fix needs
  `WeatherRepository.routeWeather` to carry the true fraction through. *Revisit*
  together with the V7 ribbon pass.

- **DS4-V21 — Detail countdown updates on a 15 s tick** vs the list's 30 s.
  *Not now:* the remedy ("unify tick sources") spans two independent ViewModels
  for a barely-perceptible effect — minute-granularity countdowns don't visibly
  change faster than 15 s anyway. *Revisit* if a shared clock source lands for
  another reason.

---

## Open general issues

- **G1 — Hardcoded English strings** (partially fixed by #28): "Departs in"/
  "Lands in"/"Landed" (list `phaseTime`), timeline labels "Boarding"/"Pushback"/
  "Takeoff"/"Landing"/"Gate arrival", `ATTRIBUTION_TEXT`, "Weather data by
  Open-Meteo.com", map attribution line. (glm 5.5 is the same finding.)

- **G9 — remaining test gaps:** `InstanceSelector` date-pinning path,
  `CadencePolicy` at the exact 48 h boundary (the NotificationPlanner suite
  landed in #40).

---

## Open performance items

- **P2 — Ribbon/weather recomputed on every snapshot insert:** the
  `fetchedAt` gate re-runs suncalc (~1000 samples) + two weather calls per
  refresh even when times are identical. Gate on (route, wheelsUp, wheelsDown);
  refresh METARs on their own cadence.
- **P3 — First-launch reference import races the UI:** enrichment returns nulls
  during the CSV import and never retries. Trigger re-enrichment on completion.
- **P5 — remainder: theme flash on cold start.** The `values-night` window
  theme landed (#25); the theme spec is still collected with a default
  `initialValue` — read the first value blocking or cache it in a fast-path
  pref.
- **P6 — No baseline profile / macrobenchmark** (PLAN M4's `:benchmark`).
- **glm 2.3 — 13-way detail `combine` rebuilds everything per fix** (~10 s while
  airborne), recomposing heavyweight items. Split map-only state out.

---

## Visual, layout & accessibility backlog (the "premium iOS" gap)

- **V2 — remainder: motion-token adoption.** The `BlipbirdMotion` token object
  and the named push/pop screen transitions landed (July 2026); still open:
  migrating component-embedded specs (status-chip color flip, sheet present)
  onto the tokens, and the in-app reduce-motion toggle (§18).
- **V6 — remainder: no loading state while resolving.** The add sheet's date
  field is now a `DatePickerDialog` (read-only, clearable) and silent date parse
  errors are gone with it (glm 5.8); still open: no in-sheet progress indicator
  while a pasted batch resolves.
- **V7 remainder — Ribbon niggles:** weather glyphs drift left of their sample
  positions (DS4-V19); sunrise/sunset times render in device TZ unlabeled;
  events can crowd on narrow phones.
- **V10 — Top bars don't collapse** (`scrollBehavior`); large-title collapse is
  half the "expensive iOS" gestalt.
- **V12 — remainder: large-screen pass.** Detail two-pane landed; list/tablet
  grid and landscape-specific layouts still open.
- **glm 3.8 — Plane glyphs always point right** in the list/hero route rows —
  a LHR→NRT flight visually flies backwards.
- **glm 3.10 — No loading skeletons** (PLAN §9.2 now specifies them, #13).

---

## Missing features (value ÷ effort ordered)

- **F2 — remainder: auto-archive on landing.** The "Past flights" section
  landed — archived flights are now browsable from the list top bar, and each can
  be restored or permanently deleted (closing the recoverability gap where an
  archived flight vanished once the undo snackbar dismissed). Still open:
  automatically archiving landed flights after ~24 h. *(S)*
- **F5 — "Boarding" as a real status** — ADB `boarding`/`gateClosed` collapse
  into SCHEDULED; `strings.xml` already ships the word. *(M)*
- **F7 — "Next flight" Glance widget.** *(M)*
- **F10 — Layover awareness** — chained tracked flights: connection time +
  buffer warnings. *(M)*
- **F11 — Trip grouping** (PLAN v2). *(M)*
- **F12 — Per-flight notification profiles** (PLAN §12.1). *(M)*
- **F13 — Flight log / Passport stats** (needs summary rows kept past the
  prune). *(L)*
- **F14 — Export/import user data** (PLAN M4). *(S)*
- **F15 — In-app airline/airport info** — alliance, check-in URL, Maps deep
  link. *(S)*
- **F16 — Offline projected mode** (PLAN §13). *(L)*
- **F17 — remainder: rename from the detail screen** (list long-press rename
  landed; detail overflow menu still open). *(S)*
- **DS4-F18 — "Track return flight"** button that inverts the city pair. *(S)*
- **glm 5.3 — Day grouping in the list** for multi-day trips. *(S)*

## Ideas (novel / delightful / quirky)

- **I5 — Jet-lag ribbon extension** — "body clock" strip from the daylight
  engine (shift = +7 h; light-exposure suggestion).
- **I7 — Cockpit auto-engage** during the airborne window at night ("dim cabin
  lights"), reverting after landing.
- **I8 — Ribbon scrubbing** — drag to read time/position/weather at that
  fraction (samples are in memory; PLAN §9.4 scrubber landed in #14 at plan
  level).
- **I9 — Landed confetti** (respecting reduced-motion).
- **I11 — "Point at the sky" AR** — parked as v-later.
- **DS4-I12–I15 — Ideas:** shared live-progress link; tail-number "spotted"
  badge when the tracked registration matches ADS-B; altitude-profile
  sparkline from the fix history; timezone-hopping indicator ("UTC+2 → UTC+8").

---

## Plan → code gaps (the merged PLAN additions the code doesn't realize yet)

- **Injectable `core.time.Clock`** — code still reads `Instant.now()` directly
  across the repository and domain cores; introduce, inject, fake in tests.
- **`ProviderHealth`/`CircuitBreaker` + rate-limit buckets** — the chain just
  `continue`s on error; no OPEN/HALF_OPEN state, no per-host token bucket.
- **`CrashRouter`** — formalize/redact the basic crash logger per plan.
- **Design-token system** (`BlipbirdTypography`/`Motion`/`Shapes`/`Elevation`),
  predictive back, theme schedule — PLAN §10.2 exists; code doesn't.
- **Delighters in code** — Pickup Mode, route-diagram hero, sunset headline,
  sunrise alarm, reverse-geocode, contrail, scrubber (PLAN §9/§11/§12/§14).
- **A11y foundations — remainder:** the §18 48 dp scaffold + `semantics`
  conventions as a systematic pass (#59 landed the first slice).

## Plan-level leftovers (from glm §8, not yet in PLAN.md)

M0 scope split (M0a engineering / M0b legal); module-split heuristic;
primary-key strategy note; `hilt-navigation-compose` build-time guard; R8
keep-rule checklist; provider-cost simulator; FTS search; per-event lead-time
customization; notification actions; Wear OS complication; clipboard-text
export; third "airport departure board" widget; usability-testing budget;
CLA/DCO process.

## Suggested next cycle

(The previous next-cycle list landed wholesale via #63–#67: small fixes, G5
outcome surfacing, V2 motion core, the F6 flagship, and the G10 nav rework.)

1. Quick wins: glm 1.19 receiver timeouts, B18 quota race, DS4-P10/P7 thread
   hops, glm 2.2/P4 recomposition hygiene.
2. V2 remainder — migrate component-embedded animation specs onto the
   BlipbirdMotion tokens; in-app reduce-motion toggle (§18).
3. Polish pass: V5 empty map card, V6 add-sheet date picker, V7 ribbon
   niggles, V9 detail density, V10 collapsing top bars.
4. Next feature from the value/effort list: F2 auto-archive or F5 real
   Boarding status.
5. Structural: P2 ribbon/weather recompute gating; glm 2.3 detail-state split.
